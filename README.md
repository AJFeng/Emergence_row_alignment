This is the code related to our paper 'Geo-referencing Single Images from Consumer UAV using Image Processing' authored by Aijing Feng, Chin Nee Vong, Jing Zhou, Lance S. Conway, Jianfeng Zhou, Earl D. Vories, Kenneth A. Sudduth and Newell R. Kitchen.

The goal of this study was to develop a real-time image processing pipeline to process individual UAV images with improved geo-reference accuracy for further crop emergence mapping at field-scale. 

The novelty of this study is to provide an improved geo-reference accuracy image processing workflow in processing sequential individual UAV images.
The position accuracy had been improved to 0.17 ± 0.13 m and 0.57 ± 0.28 m (average ± standard deviation) for cotton and corn field, respectively, when compared to the accuracy obtained from an image processing workflow of a previous study (1.72 ± 1.37 m and 2.13 ± 1.89 m).
Further, the workflow also includes field-scale mapping of different crop emergence parameters such as stand count, canopy area, day after first emergence, and plant spacing standard deviation.
Meanwhile, the processing time of the workflow are 10.4 and 5.7 s/image for cotton and corn field, respectively, which is extremely lower than the time needed for image stitching from commercial software (88.7 and 97.4 s/image).

This new method can act as a low-cost real time tool to quantify crop early emergence in a shorter time and lower cost. Further application can be exploring relationship between crop emergence and environmental factors, weather conditions, and different treatments for researchers as well as field scouting for farmers especially for area inaccessible by ground vehicles.
